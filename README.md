# Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Date Time Format

The first step to create our analysis is to change the exported data "NYC_CitiBike_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb." Here the column "tripduration" will be transformed from an interger data type to a datetime data type. The transoformation is required to be able to identify how long the bikes were in use.

# Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

## Checkout Times for Users
The first vizualization shows the relationship between the amount of bikes checked out by the user and the length of time the bikes. By creating this graph, one can have a snap shot of the current use of the bikes.

## Checkout Times by Gender
The second vizualization shows breaks down the previous graph and shows the usage by the different genders. This is important as it gives an insight on who the main customers are and which demographic is not being reached.

## Trips by Weekday for Each Hour
The third vizualization shows the break down of the how  many bikes are being used during specific times of the week. This important as it shows the peak and low usage rates. This information allows to know the best times to do preventive maintaince on the equipment as well as how many bikes should be at hand during specific times.

## Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
The fourth vizualizationbreaks down the usage for the week by gender. This way one can see that the usage time is similar betweent the two genders. The only difference is the amount of usage.

## User Trips by Gender by Weekday
The fifth vizualization gives a similar report as the fourth but it's based on the day of the week. This vizualization also gives an insight on the different usage based on wether one is a customer vs a subscriber. This allows one to see another potetial gap/opportunity.

# Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
The Final part of this activity is to summarize and create a story. The power point below delves into into how the usage of the bikes is broken down. This goes into the break down of a general overview and than it compares the breakdown by gender.
